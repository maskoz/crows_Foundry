Personal work on Crows for Foundry. 

# MCDM Crows — Foundry VTT System

A community-built Foundry VTT system for the **MCDM Crows TTRPG public playtest**, tracking the
**second playtest packet (August–September 2026)**.

> **Disclaimer.** This is a fan-made implementation. *Crows* is © MCDM Productions. This system exists to make the playtest playable at the virtual table — playtests need to be played for MCDM to get feedback. If MCDM requests changes or removal, that will be honored.

## The playtest packet

The rulebooks, character sheet, and other reference documents are **not** distributed here. Grab them directly from MCDM:

> **[MCDM Productions on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/MCDM)** — look for the **Crows August/September 2026 playtest packet**.

This system implements those rules. You need the packet to read what the game *is*; this repo gives you the table to play it on.

> **Playtest 1 → 2 is not a patch.** Conditions were rebuilt, the chaos count was replaced,
> initiative changed shape entirely, and every compendium pack was re-transcribed from the new
> books. A world built on the Playtest 1 version of this system migrates, but expect to re-check
> characters against the new rules.

## See the village map

**[Live demo →](https://dimitroffvodka.github.io/crows_playtest/)** — no install, no Foundry.

[![Balhaunis in daylight, choked by the Miasma, and at night](demo/preview.png)](https://dimitroffvodka.github.io/crows_playtest/)

Balhaunis is authored, not generated — the roads, the ground and every plot are fixed. Found an
institution and it appears on the plot that was being held for it; move Prosperity and the homes,
fields and woodland fill in behind it, always in the same order, so a village that falls on hard
times and recovers gets the identical village back.

Hover a building to name it, click it to see the room inside and what its next level costs, and
raise it to watch it grow on its plot — levels have no art of their own, so size is what an upgrade
looks like. Name the village and it is written across the map. Roll in the **Miasma** and it chokes
everything the ruin does not enclose (C:2218), which is the whole point of living inside one.

The page calls the system's own `buildVillageProjection()` for every frame rather than a copy of it.
See [`demo/`](demo/) for how that is wired, how to run it locally, and for the separate procedural
layout engine that plans a settlement from a seed.

## What's in the box

### Rules pipeline
- **2d10 tier-roll engine** — Tier 1 ≤11, Tier 2 12–16, Tier 3 17+. Auto doom/crit on raw faces. Mod-chain chat cards with an explicit commit point, so an expertise can be spent *after* the roll and before anything downstream fires.
- **Slot inventory** — 2 hand, 4 belt, 10 backpack, plus six worn magic slots (head/neck/waist/arms/finger/feet). Multi-slot items must be contiguous; wounds fill backpack slots. Cards drag between slots, swap when you drop one onto another, and can be added or removed in place.
- **Conditions** — six, and **none of them have levels**: `blessed`, `grabbed`, `prone`, `unconscious`, `vulnerable`, `weakened`. Bidirectionally synced with Active Effects and token statuses. (Playtest 1's `boned` is gone — it split into `weakened` and `vulnerable`.)
- **Damage application** — Armor Dice → Stamina → Wounds, with multi-armor priority dialog (shield → light → medium → heavy) and Piercing (bypasses AD).
- **Spellcasting** — full pipeline with Usage-Die-on-cast, the **per-cast chaos roll** (1d6 on a non-doom tier 1; a 1 triggers a backlash), doom-on-cast = immediate backlash, and a d100+rank backlash table.
- **Combat and initiative** — **side-based, per the rules**: one 1d10 at the start of every round decides whether the crows or their enemies act first, re-rolled each round, with order *within* a side chosen rather than rolled. Ships a replacement combat tracker with the side roll, per-side grouping, manual reordering, and **Surprised** (skipped in round 1, +1 to attacks against them).
- **Dungeon Turn** — counter, end-of-DT pipeline (UD rolls, expiry of `blessed`/`vulnerable`/`weakened`, encounter check), GM-callable.
- **Rest** — 6-hour rest with auto-restore, encounter checks every 2h (skipped in town), rest activities: Tend Wounds / Identify Item / Prepare for Task / Craft Equipment / Harvest.

### Downtime systems
- **Miasma** — outdoor 24h resist test (2d10 + M + Endurance), Effects table dispatch with effect-id dedup, cruelty accumulation, catastrophic result → permanent NPC.
- **Crypt boons** — 10-boon institution with internment registry, once-per-cycle prayer, mechanical hooks for Vitality / Fury / Swiftness boons; chat-card scaffolds for the rest.
- **Village** — Prosperity tracker (−10..+10), 10-day cycles, institution registry, end-of-cycle event roll (d10 + Prosperity), GM management dialog, and an authored village map projected onto a Scene as Tiles, filling in with Prosperity ([see it in the browser](https://dimitroffvodka.github.io/crows_playtest/)).
- **Crafting** — projects with prereqs/materials/goal, special-Mind crafting roll (doom=0, crit=re-roll, min 1), Identify Item 2d10+M tiered test.
- **Advancement** — TXP threshold table for expertise/stamina and characteristic bonuses, trait-tree purchase UI (4×3 grid per tree, `connectsTo` gating), XP-grant macros.
- **Pets** — taming, bonding, ownership transfer, and combat commands, with the command test the rules require.

### Character creator
- Roll 2d6 for a background or pick from all 36.
- **Characteristics are set, not incremented.** Your background makes one characteristic a **2**; some fix which one, some offer a choice. You then pick a spread for the other two: **1 / 0** or **2 / −1**.
- Applies the background's expertise **uses**, stamina, equipment, spellbooks and starting trait, plus the universal kit — **coin purse, knife, rope, six rations, and 3d6 gc** (some backgrounds add coins on top).
- The four backgrounds that grant an animal spawn it as an Actor, bonded to the crow.

### Sheets
- **Crow PC sheet** — tabs: **Main / Equipment / Inventory / Pets / Advancement / Downtime / Bio**. The Bio tab records what your background granted.
- **Monster sheet** — rulebook stat-block format with inline GM edits, attack roll buttons, condition toggles, apply-damage dialog.
- **Item cards** — printed-card layouts per item type.

### Compendium content
- **13 packs**: backgrounds (36), traits (276 across 23 trees), weapons, armor, **enchantments (40)**, gear, consumables, ammunition, spellbooks, monsters (71), loot, the rules-reference journal, and **31 rollable tables** (backlashes, miasma effects, encounters, weather, interesting things, dungeon hooks and more).
- All content transcribed from the Playtest 2 packet and cross-checked against the books. Where a card and a rulebook disagree, the card wins and the divergence is recorded in `docs/discrepancies/`.

### Bundled play assets

`playtest-packet/` ships a few play-time assets so you don't have to bring your own:

- **`Art/`** — monster portraits and scene art — drop straight onto tokens or scenes.
- **`Maps/`** — Blood Library starter-dungeon battlemaps (labeled and unlabeled, including 8k).
- **`Crows Character & Inventory Sheets.xlsx`** — the official paper character sheet.

The rulebooks, monster cards, loot cards, and cheat sheet are **not** bundled — grab them from MCDM. These assets are repo-only; they aren't in the Foundry install zip.

## GM Quickstart

1. **Install the system** via the manifest URL above; create a new world using "MCDM Crows (Playtest)".
2. **Configure world settings** (Game Settings → Configure Settings → System Settings):
   - **Default Dungeon EN** — the 1d6 threshold for encounter checks (default 6 = lenient, lower = more encounters).
   - **Party is in the Miasma** — ON when the party is overland in Cornath; OFF indoors or in town.
   - **Crypt Level** — fallback when there is no Village yet; once the Village exists, Crypt level is read from there.
3. **Create the village** — any crow's sheet → Downtime tab → **Manage…** on the Village strip.
4. **Make a player character** — create an Actor (type: crow) → Bio tab → **Open Character Creator**. Roll or pick a background, set the characteristic it grants and choose your spread, name the crow and its NPC connection.
5. **Run combat** — drag a monster onto the scene and add both sides to the tracker. Click **Roll for the round**: a 6+ puts the crows first, 5 or lower the enemies. Walk the turns; the next round re-rolls. Mark anyone caught unaware as **Surprised** — they are skipped in round 1 and attacks against them gain +1.
6. **Attack** — put a weapon in a **hand** slot (only a wielded weapon can attack; the sheet says so on any weapon that isn't). Target a token with `T`, or just click Attack and pick from the prompt. The chat card's Apply T2 / Apply T3 buttons run damage through AD → Stamina → Wounds.
7. **End-of-DT** — the GM **End DT** button on any crow's Time strip rolls DT-expiry usage dice, clears `blessed`/`vulnerable`/`weakened`, and rolls an encounter check.
8. **Rest** — the **Rest…** dialog picks the activity and offers **Town rest** to skip encounter checks. Outdoor non-town rests auto-roll a Miasma resist when the world flag is on.
9. **End Village Cycle** — Downtime → Manage → End Cycle. Docks Prosperity if nothing was founded or upgraded, then rolls the event.

The `game.crows.*` API is exposed for macros — `game.crows.dt.end()`, `game.crows.creator.open(actor)`, `game.crows.village.found(...)`, `game.crows.miasma.resist(...)`, `game.crows.crypt.pray(...)`, `game.crows.rollTest(...)`. See `module/crows.mjs` for the full surface.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Source content lives under `src/packs/` as YAML; built LevelDB packs are in `packs/` (committed). To rebuild after editing YAML:

```bash
npm install
npm run pack       # build every pack from src/packs
npm run unpack     # extract LevelDB -> YAML (rare, for round-tripping)
npm test           # the suite
./verify.sh --strict
npm run release    # gated build of dist/crows.zip
```

**Foundry holds an exclusive lock on the LevelDB packs while a world is open**, so return to Setup before rebuilding or packing will fail.

You'll need [`@foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli`](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli), installed via `npm install`.
